                    <h4>The Summary</h4>
                    <p>Hey, we recommend you should read these terms and conditions thoroughly because they apply every time you visit Travel Mates and use any of its features or functionality. However, just in case you ever need a reminder of the main points, here’s a quick summary:
If you are under the age of 18, then, unfortunately, you can’t use Travel Mates yet because it’s meant for adults only.</p>
<p>We’re not responsible for anything that you post, live stream, or say while you are on Travel Mates, and we don’t monitor the Content of the site. Still, if we do see or someone alerts us that you have posted something that we think is inappropriate, then we are allowed at our discretion to remove it.
If you post any content that belongs to someone else and they get hurt, we are not in the firing line. You are responsible for what you post.</p>
<p>Please refer to our Community Guidelines and Safety Tips for additional Dos and Don’ts, and information on staying safe.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about how Travel Mates are using your data, then please refer to our Privacy Policy, which explains how we treat your data and protect your privacy when you use Travel Mates.

</p>
<h4>Are there any rules relating to personal data like my email address?
</h4>
<p>You may not display any personal contact or banking information on your profile page (“Profile”) whether about you or any other person (for example, names, home addresses or postcodes, telephone numbers, email addresses, URLs, credit/debit card or other banking details, or place of work). If you do choose to reveal any personal data about yourself to other users, whether via email or otherwise, it is at your own risk. We encourage you to use the same caution in disclosing details about yourself to third parties online, as you would under any other circumstances. You are required to follow our Guidelines and Safety Tips when doing so.

Travel Mates reserves the right to terminate your account or prevent access to its features if you misuse other users’ information.

</h4>
<p>The short answer is NO. Only you are authorized to access your account with Travel Mates.

If you suspect that someone has gained access to your account, you must let us know immediately by visiting the Feedback page and telling us of your suspicions or concerns.

</p>
<h4>Who can see the Content that I put on Travel Mates?

We have no obligation to display any Content that you provide to Travel Mates, nor to check the accuracy or truthfulness of any Content submitted to Travel Mates, nor to monitor your use or the use of other users of Travel Mates.
</p>

</p>
<p>You can change your Auto Top-up at any time in your payment settings on your profile page. The pricing may vary due to several factors, such as (but not limited to) promotional offers, loyalty bonuses, and other discounts.

</p>
<h4>Do my credits last forever?

</p>
<p>Please refer to the Service Conditions on your ‘top-up’ page for further details relating to your payments.
</p>
<h3>4. Access to the app and site
</h3>
<h4>Do you guarantee that Travel Mates will be up and running at all times?
</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, we can’t guarantee that because sometimes we have to carry out maintenance to the app or site, or they may be affected by a fault or circumstances which are outside our control, so Travel Mates is provided on an “as is” “as available” basis. No warranty is given about the quality, accuracy, functionality, availability or performance of Travel Mates and we reserve the right to suspend, withdraw, amend, modify or vary the service provided on Travel Mates without notice and without incurring any liability to you.
</p>
<h4>What about mobile access?
</h4>
<p>You are responsible for making all the necessary arrangements to ensure you can access Travel Mates (including, but not limited to, Internet provider and mobile internet provider fees and any other charges associated with such access). We shall not be held responsible for any reduced functionality you may encounter as a result of or in connection with accessing Travel Mates through mobile services or any similar service currently known or developed in the future.
</p>
<p>By accessing Travel Mates or agreeing to receive messages or notifications from Travel Mates through your mobile phone or any other connected media device, you accept that you may incur charges from your internet or mobile service provider. We shall not under any circumstances be liable for such costs.
</p>
<h4>I’m not registered, and I can’t seem to access some Content or features on the app or site. Why is that?
</h4>
<p>Non-registered users can access only that portion of Travel Mates that is publicly available. They will not have a Profile but may have limited ability to upload any Content. The extent of registered users’ access to Travel Mates will depend on specific criteria relating to their profile being met. We may change or update the rules from time to time without prior notice and at our discretion.
</p>
<h3>5. Payments
</h3>
<p>The payments once made cannot be refunded according to our policy. However, if you are willing to cancel your subscription, then you can do so that with the help of our  FAQ. The user can make payments with the help of a Debit/Credit card. Travel Mates makes sure that our users get a very safe and secure platform to make their payments.
</p>
<h4>Fraud and Termination</h4>
<p>All cash-out transactions will be reviewed by Travel Mates. Travel Mates takes fraud extremely seriously.
</p>
<h3>6. Termination of use by us
</h3>
<h4>My profile has disappeared, and I can’t log in. What’s going on?
</h4>
<p>Sometimes people forget about the Terms and post Content or act in a way while on Travel Mates, which is not consistent with the purpose of the app or site. If we think that you may be one of those people, then we reserve the right at our sole discretion, at any time and without liability or the need to give you prior notice or to refund any unused services to:
</p>
<p>Suspend or revoke your registration (where applicable) and your right to access or use Travel Mates or submit any Content to Travel Mates; and
</p>
<p>Make use of any operational, technological, legal, or other means available to enforce the Terms (including without limitation blocking specific IP addresses).
</p>
<p>We will try (but we are not obliged) to notify you if your access to Travel Mates or your Profile is to be or has been suspended or terminated. Where you have acted contrary to our Terms, we will keep a record of it and may block future attempts by you to use or access Travel Mates and its features so that we can keep Travel Mates a fun place.
</p>

<h3>7. Termination of use by you
</h3>
<p><b>They say that you can have too much of a good thing…</b>
</p>
<p>what do I do if I want to “unregister” myself from Travel Mates?
</p>
<p>If you have registered on Travel Mates, you can terminate your registration at any time by going to the ‘Settings’ control on Travel Mates when you are logged in and choosing the ‘deactivate profile’ link. We save your profile information in case you later decide to restore your account. Many users deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so, expect us to maintain their information until they return to Travel Mates. You will, therefore, be able to restore your account and your profile in its entirety within 30 days of deactivating it. Once your registration is terminated, we have the right to delete any related Content that you have submitted or uploaded on to Travel Mates.
</p>
<p>Content that you have uploaded to Travel Mates, other than your profile (such as comments or email messages), may still appear on Travel Mates following termination of your registration.
</p>
<h3>8. Abuse/Complaints
</h3>
<h4>Someone is not obeying the Terms, who do I tell?
</h4>
<p>You can report any abuse or complain about Content on Travel Mates by contacting us via the Feedback page, outlining the abuse and or complaint. You can also report a user directly from a profile by clicking the ‘Report Abuse’ link on their profile, choosing the reason for the claim, and providing us with any additional information you think fit.
</p>
<p>We will always try our best to help resolve any issue that you may encounter with our service. If your complaint or dispute remains unresolved, however, you may be eligible to use the European Commission’s online dispute resolution platform here.
</p>
<h3>9. Privacy Policy
</h3>
<h4>Do you have guidelines in place about what you can do with my data?
</h4>

<h3>11. Disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability
</h3>

</h4>

We expressly disclaim any responsibility and liability for your conduct or the conduct of any other user of Travel Mates and expressly disclaim any liability for Content uploaded by you or by any other user.
